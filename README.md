Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves understanding a dataset by summarizing its main characteristics and often representing them visually. This step is particularly crucial when preparing to model the data for Machine Learning applications. EDA typically includes plotting techniques such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and more. It often requires a significant amount of time to thoroughly explore the data. The EDA process allows us to formulate problem statements and define key aspects of our datasets, which proves invaluable in the subsequent stages of data analysis.
